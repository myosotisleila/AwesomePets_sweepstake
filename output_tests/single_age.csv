I was sick, and found at a wet market. My eyes were full of discharge, and my nose was blocked. A good market stall seller rescued me, and sent me to a vet. As my saviour has dog, he could not keep me until I am well. He has found me a fosterer, and here, I am given a chance to live until I am healthy. I am very healthy now, I need a permanent home, I don't want to be back on street or market. Please give me a permanent and loving home, and I promise you will not regret this decision. I can be a very good companion, and need very little maintenance. Please call/whatsapp/sms or to adopt me. Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.","{'owner_location_id': 41327, 'owner_account_id': '52796d04a7281246b51584240547937a'}",/homes_unix/verrecchia/workspace/sweepstakes_challenge/sample_preprocessed/01ac09f2a/pet-01ac09f2a.jpg

They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy. Interested parties may text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.","{'owner_location_id': 41401, 'owner_account_id': '13b3c0d8590208d6e60e7118bc3b98d1'}",/homes_unix/verrecchia/workspace/sweepstakes_challenge/sample_preprocessed/63d254530/pet-63d254530.jpg

She has quite a long tail and she usually loves to play with her tail, assuming the tail has been bothering her. She is able to eat solid food now and she is not the fussy type (as long she can eat).

Still, she is fun to be with. The reason of giving out as adoption: Actually it's my aunt's pet but her current place doesn't allow any pets in the house, therefore she needs to find someone who can take care of Fifi. I also have my own pets (quite a number of it), so I can't afford to adopt another one. Fifi has been vaccinated, and follow-up MUST BE DONE and she MUST BE SPAYED once she is 6 months old.
