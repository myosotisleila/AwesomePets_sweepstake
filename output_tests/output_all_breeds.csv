a37c82165,dog,Doggie,12,nan,Golden,1,2,1,2001-07-30T00:00:00,"This dog was once owned by my neighbour when it was a puppy. When it grew big, and they have a baby sitting business in the house, they decided to abandon it. And they abandoned it right outside their house. However, the loyal dog slept outside their house for months, rain or shine, hoping to get back in. It grew thinner day by day, until I decided to take it in. This chocolate brown dog is very smart and loyal. It learnt simple tricks within a day, e.g. ""sit"", ""paw"" and ""lie down"". It could also ""fetch"" but it would need a bit more persistent in training from the new owner to perfect this. He has been nursed back to full health and fit body condition. He has also been neutered. But not yet vaccinated.

a63f6c6a1,dog,BOY,12,nan,Golden,1,1,1,2002-05-27T00:00:00,"Update 27 Oct : on Saturday 25 Oct , Boy went to Central Park, Desa Park City and he was having a lot of fun running and walking around the lake for about 2 hours. He took the opportunity socializing with other dogs and humans. What a day for Boy. He is still looking for adopter to provide him with a loving home. I will provide the leash, collar, food tray to successful adopter. Info on Boy : 1. He is about 1 year old Mongrel; 2. Very playful and understands basic commands; 3. Suitable as Guard Dog for the whole family; 4. Vaccinated (9 in 1) and Dewormed. Currently on monthly heartworm prescription.; 5. He loves treats very much. Not a fan of kibbles but sometimes he would still take it. He loves wet canned food and consume between 2 - 3 cans a day. My conditions : 1. I will only release Boy to adopter who can provide him a loving home. I will not release him to adopters who want him to guard factory, shops, office ect; 2. Please do not tie him up unnecessarily at home as he is used to walk/run free around my house compound; He is on leash only when I take him out for a walk; 3. Please try your best to walk him daily for his exercise; 4. Boy has been trained not to enter my house. He has been trained to stay outdoor but free to be anywhere he wants around the house compound. Therefore, please spend sometimes with him daily at least a couple of hours; 5. To continue giving him his scheduled vaccination and other normal medications prescribed for canines; 6. Last but not least, again, must provide him with a loving home. 7. Should Boy is adopted by you and later you found him not suitable or you are not able to provide him with love, please return Boy back to me. Thank you. ---------------------------------- Update 23 Oct : It has been about 1.5 months Boy has been under our care. It was really fun having him around us. We brought him to Central Park, One Utama the other day and Boy demonstrated his gentleness towards other dogs and humans who came to see him. It was a happy day for me to see Boy was enjoying his day at the Park. It is sad for me to give him away but I am not able to keep him permanently. And before Boy and I get too attached with other, I seek those who can provide Boy with a loving home to contact me asap. ----------------------- Update 17 Oct : Boy will be joining an event ""I Want To Touch a Dog"" at Central Park, One Utama on Sunday 19 October . He will be there as a Volunteer. If you're joining the event, please look up for him and say hello. Boy has now fully recovered from his injury. Boy still looking for a loving home. ----------------------- Update 6 Oct : Boy is now a ""legal"" resident. Obtained license for him at MPSJ. Now he is proud resident of Subang Jaya. Boy still looking for a loving home. ---------------------- Update 5 Oct : Boy has almost recovered from his injury and now is really playful and wonderful dog. Just brought him to the vet for a 9-in-1 vaccination today. For last couple of days he learned to play ""fetch"" and loves playing ""soccer"" with my kids. Just uploaded a new video of him playing ""fetch"" ----------------------- Playful Boy up for adoption. Very loyal and listen to your command. Give him a chance and he will be with you for life. Boy (this is what I call him) came to my house gate on Saturday morning 13 September looking scared and hungry and he was limping a bit due to swollen front left leg. I believe he had been hit by a moving vehicle or could have been hit by someone. Since I pity him, I fed him with my cat food and let him drink a lot of water. He was very cautious when I approached him. To cut long story short, he finally decided to enter my house compound and I have decided to provide him with shelter and food until he is ok or find a new home. I am not sure if he was a stray dog but he had no collar when he came to my house. I find him very gentle and too smart to be stray. he does not simply bark although the other dogs in the area are barking. Up todate he has become an excellent companion. This afternoon (Monday 22 Sep) a Vet came to my house just to check him up. Since he was afraid with the doctor, we were not able to vaccinate him. However, I have given him pills for deworming and pain killer for his swollen leg. Due to circumstances, I am not able to keep him permanently although it would be sad for me to let him go. I pray to God, a good samaritan would want to adopt him and provide him with a loving home. Please call me if you are the owner or interested to adopt or foster him.

He has on a frayed yellowish collar, so he could've been lost for a while, as he's also very skinny, and he's already neutered when found. Estimated age to be about 1 year old, as he still pees like a gal and has young teeth and good skin. Found in Ara Damansara, though he could've come from anywhere if he's been lost for sometime. He knows how to sit, shake hand and come. He can walk off-leash following people (those who show kindness to him). He sits well in the car. VERY PEOPLE FRIENDLY (so must've been treated very well by humans during his early months). He was hanging around near an unoccupied house in the residential area with the two other dogs despite occasionally being beaten by one particular resident who dislike ""strays."" They also take shelter at a nearby field in the residential area. They've been roaming the area probably since December . If nobody claims him in a week, we'd like to have him adopted! This is a dog that will reward it's keepers with affection and guarding of family property! He is kept at a neighbour's house for a few days, and he will bark at unknown passers-by and unknown cars parked near the house. Would be great if adopters take in another of his buddies from the streets too. He loves attention and freedom. When chained, will whine CONTINUOUSLY for attention if he knows that dog-lovers are within hearing distance. When left to roam free within the compound of the home, he's a real darling! He's quiet, he naps, he's playful when people are around, he's alert when he sees strangers - the perfect dog for a family who'd spend time playing and running/walking him! He makes a wonderful companion dog as well as an alert dog (eg. alert family of possible intruders). Would be great if new owners can take in 2 or more pets. We've taken in this lovely dog and his 2 companions, and he seems to love having other dogs around! Note: SAFE AROUND CATS! He's curious in chasing and approaching them, but non-agressive and stays 2 feet away from usually hissing cats that he approaches! update on: 1st Feb Open for adoption!!! This darling doggie is now kept with another stray who appears to be the ""brother"". The brother was found intact, and when they first started roaming Ara Damansara, was average in weight. however, after roaming for over a month (as sighted by rescuer), he got skinnier and skinnier. The brother is very good on leash, hardly barks, just wags tail when see loving humans and doesn't jump. would be great if a family can adopt BOTH DOGS, as they tend to be happier and quieter and get to play together.",41326,07184fe71e0dc6ad58406e228719fd21,/homes_unix/verrecchia/workspace/sweepstakes_challenge/sample_preprocessed/b857d5ac6/pet-b857d5ac6.jpg

She is a large cat with very striking tabby markings and a bold personality to match! I work at Zoo Negara and sadly we have a lot of people dumping pets at the zoo. Cats can spread disease to the zoo animals, so the zoo staff are forced to catch the cats and ""get rid"" of them to ensure the safety and health of the other animals on site. Kate is one of these cats, and is looking for a ""forever"" home where she can share her love and affection with an understanding owner. I estimate she is around one year old, and she was caught along with two kittens which are also up for adoption (same tabby stripe markings, also up for adoption). Although she has not been vaccinated/ dewormed/ spayed yet, all of these will be done if you agree to adopt her. She has a full tail. Kate is a really beautiful and friendly cat and will make a great cat for any family, even one with children as she is very playful. Please get in touch if you need any more information.

When I approached him, I realised he could not stand as his right leg was injured. Managed to transport him to the Vet. X ray showed that he suffers from pelvic bone and tail bone fracture. The pelvic bone fracture, according to the vet, will heal by itseslf but the tail may have to be amputated. There WAS no anal tone, hence he couldn't control his bowel movement. Currently he is still in the animal hospital and besides conventional treatment, he is also undergoing acupuncture treatment. I am so happy to hear from the vet few days ago that the anal tone is coming back. So this mean the possibility of him regaining control of his bowel movement is very high. He is a very clean conscious dog. Keeps on licking himself and can paw whenever you extend your hand! He will give the other paw when u ask for ""Another Paw""! The potential owner has to be very committed as it may be quite messy if the treatment is not successful. (I think he will recover fully) But he is of a very good nature and estimated to be less than a year old. A waste if we have to put it down. Attached are pictures of this beautiful dog.

She was given rice and a shirt inside a box only. Her skin condition was very bad and she can barely moved back then. She was so emaciated i can see all her ribs! I took her to the vet and paid for all her medication. I couldn't bring her back home as I have 2 dogs already. My mom wouldn't allow me to bring her back. So she stayed at the vet for almost 2 months until i found a shelter who is willing to take her in under the condition that i pay them every month. I agreed as I do not wish for her to be caged her whole life. After almost 6 months at the shelter, I got a call to pick her up because the shelter received an eviction letter. She will be moving to a smaller place and will not be able to house so many dogs. So she's giving back all the dogs that was left there. I am keeping her temporary but not for long. I thought of putting her back to the street, but her size is a bit small and she has not been on the street for so long. I'm afraid she will not survive. She is a pretty good guard dog despite her size. Very loving as well. She's very agile and fast too not to mention greedy. She will jump up the table and eat all the food. She survived after eating 12 chocolates! One hell of a tough dog I must say. I'm running out of time, really desperate for an adopter. I really do not wish to put her back on the street.

He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him. He has also learn how to socialize. Adopter criteria: I need someone who's confident handling him. Better with experience and someone who's responsible and committed. view video of him suckling palm:","{'owner_location_id': 41326, 'owner_account_id': '74dabecce4ddb0c4d08892255974496b'}",/homes_unix/verrecchia/workspace/sweepstakes_challenge/sample_preprocessed/70c811b9d/pet-70c811b9d.jpg
