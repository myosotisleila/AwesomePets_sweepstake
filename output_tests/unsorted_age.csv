She is a large cat with very striking tabby markings and a bold personality to match! I work at Zoo Negara and sadly we have a lot of people dumping pets at the zoo. Cats can spread disease to the zoo animals, so the zoo staff are forced to catch the cats and ""get rid"" of them to ensure the safety and health of the other animals on site. Kate is one of these cats, and is looking for a ""forever"" home where she can share her love and affection with an understanding owner. I estimate she is around one year old, and she was caught along with two kittens which are also up for adoption (same tabby stripe markings, also up for adoption). Although she has not been vaccinated/ dewormed/ spayed yet, all of these will be done if you agree to adopt her. She has a full tail.

GERBERA is a tropical plant of the daisy family, native to Asia and Africa, with large brightly colored flowers. Just like this little kitten that we are fostering - Gerbera, she is as beautiful as the flower. Gerbera was rescued months ago at a food court, she was only a 2 months old baby during that time. Poor little baby was hiding under a car and meowing loudly seeking for help as there were a group of excited dogs wanted to hunt her and they kept running and waiting around the car. With help of some kind people there, we managed to shooed those doggie away and brought her home. Gerbera loves a lot to have companion and friends, she do not like much to be cuddled but she will always stay beside you and ask for a pat and ""massage"", she lovesss a lot when people sayang her. Gerbera is always happy when we're back home, she will always purr when we're at her side. But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends. She can eat together with friends if in different bowl but when they re eating same bowl of food, she will be very nervous and lift up her front paw to stop anyone from nearing the bowl but of course she do not bite or hurt anyone..

Saya mula memberi dia makan semenjak 2-3 bulan yang lepas. Dia muncul di rumah saya secara tiba2 & dari entah mana. Saya pun terus memberikan dia makanan & minuman setiap hari. Umur Fifi ni saya tak pasti, tapi saya rasa dia belom mencapai umur setahun lagi. Seminggu dua lepas, saya perasan yang dia ada kurap sedikit di bahagian telinga jadi saya terus bawa dia ke vet. Alang-alang tu, saya ambil keputusan untuk spay/mandulkan Fifi sekali. Sekarang luka pembedahan pemandulan/spaying Fifi serta kurapnya sudah hampir pulih. Dulu masa mula2, Fifi agak garang & amat takut dengan manusia, walaupun dengan saya yang setiap hari bagi dia makan. Tapi, lepas bawak dia balik dari spaying ni, baru saya tahu yang rupa-rupanya Fifi ni adalah seekor kucing yang teramat manja & perlukan kasih sayang & belaian. Dia langsung dah tak garang lagi malah akan kerap datang dekat dengan saya untuk menggosok2 badannya. Pendek kata, sekarang Fifi amat friendly & sangatlah manja. Saya rasa sayang & kesian sekiranya kucing yang manja sebegini terus hidup sebagai seekor kucing stray, jadi saya nak put her up for adoptian. Moga2 Fifi akan dapat forever home & tuan yang akan menyayanginya dengan sepenuh hati. Tiada apa-apa caj yang dikenakan. Fifi pun telah di spay. Adopter hanya perlu memastikan Fifi akan divaksinkan & dinyahkutu & dinyahcacing dalam masa terdekat. That's all. Fifi ni seekor stray cat yang bersifat teramat-amat manja. It would be a pity if she remains a stray after her spaying surgery. Hence I'm looking for an adopter for her. Dia suka dengan belaian & sentuhan orang & akan mengiau-ngiau sehingga dapat belaian dari orang. Dia juga bersifat attention-seeking dan suka berada di mana sahaja orang berada. She needs a lot of loving. Please adopt her someone.

A check at the vet found hookworms, fleas and also that he had flu. Bagheerah has since bloomed tremendously and is now seeking a loving family. --------------------------------------------------------------- Details: ♥ Bagheerah is an EXTREMELY affectionate boy and loves, loves, LOVES people! (Please view videos below, although only visits could do his character justice!). ♥ A softie - Bagheerah is extremely gentle. Would do great in homes with elderly people or children. He never uses his claws except when playing or giving love nips. ♥ He's friendly around other (non-agressive) cats as well, submissive and calm. Adapts very quickly to new environments! ♥ Bagheerah been fully vaccinated, dewormed (twice), is scheduled for neutering. He is clever with the litter box and not fussy about food. Hands down one of the best cats we've ever fostered! :) --------------------------------------------------------------- ***Important (Note for adopters)***: ○ Bagheerah would prefer being kept % indoors for his own safety. He loves trips to the garden under supervision now and then. Apartments best if cat-safe. ○ He would also appreciate a healthy diet (no commercial foods like Whiskas, Friskies etc). This is for the long term welfare of any cat, feel free inquire if unsure. Please drop me an text (WhatsApp) or call directly if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this boy a new life.

He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him. He has also learn how to socialize. Adopter criteria: I need someone who's confident handling him. Better with experience and someone who's responsible and committed. view video of him suckling palm:","{'owner_location_id': 41326, 'owner_account_id': '74dabecce4ddb0c4d08892255974496b'}",/homes_unix/verrecchia/workspace/sweepstakes_challenge/sample_preprocessed/70c811b9d/pet-70c811b9d.jpg

She tried to catch our attention by sitting on my husband's shoe. Who could say no to this little fella so me & hub decided to bring her home. After treatment, she grew strong and playful. She is full of affection. She will search for fingers and feet, just to get a pat on the head. Marley reminds me of Mittens, the stray cat in animated cartoon Bolt. I am searching for a loving family who can love Marley for the rest of her life. Marley is age 1 year old, neutered female.","{'owner_location_id': 41326, 'owner_account_id': '74dabecce4ddb0c4d08892255974496b'}",/homes_unix/verrecchia/workspace/sweepstakes_challenge/sample_preprocessed/f923ff77e/pet-f923ff77e.jpg

Saya & husband selalu beri makan dia di area rumah tapi kami akan berpindah rumah minggu ni. Kami tak mampu nk bawa pindah sekali sbb dah cukup quota kucing dlm rumah. Kucing ni sangat manja & cantik. I need adopter as soon as possible before dia beranak merata2. Kalau boleh biar yg boleh bela dia indoor & tak kurung dalam cage sbb taknak dia stress. Dan sy prefer untuk beri adopt pada yg willing untuk mandulkan Mak Teh.
